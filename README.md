# TCSMP-Documentation
 TCSMP is a client-server protocol designed to efficiently transfer mail and allow time consuming transfers. Although this might sound shocking, it is worth considering the time usage as an expense, i.e. sending a mail actually costs time. The aim is to stop spamming: sending mail to one recipient could take less than 1 sec, while sending mail to 50 could take 30 seconds! TCSMP now depends on problem solving in order to do so. More specifically, it uses puzzles which grow exponentially in complexity. The server gives the client a puzzle which has to solve it so that the server accepts its mail.
